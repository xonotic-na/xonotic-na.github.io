## About Xonotic North America

![Alt text](resources/images/xonotic-na-logo.png)

This webpage is intended to assist in providing a common place for resources that interest [Xonotic](http://xonotic.org) players of North America. In the future, I hope we can gather together a list of popular maps and servers we like to play on together and perhaps start self-organizing pick-up matches.

If you're interested in helping out, please find us in #xonotic.na on irc.quakenet.org or click the **chat** page.

Sorry this information is the same as the first post right now :)
